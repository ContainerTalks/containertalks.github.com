In this post, we\'ll explore what rqlite is, how it works, and how you can use it in your projects.\\n\\n## What is rqlite?\\n\\n**rqlite** is a distributed relational database that uses SQLite as its storage engine. It provides a distributed database system with strong consistency guarantees, fault tolerance, and easy deployment. rqlite is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for applications that require a distributed database but don\'t need the complexity of larger systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL.\\n\\n## How does rqlite work?\\n\\nrqlite uses the Raft consensus algorithm to achieve strong consistency and fault tolerance. Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be easy to understand and implement, making it a good fit for rqlite\'s goals of simplicity and reliability.\\n\\nIn a rqlite cluster, one node serves as the leader, and the rest are followers. Clients interact with the leader node, which replicates their requests to the followers. If the leader fails, one of the followers is elected as the new leader, ensuring that the system remains available even in the face of failures.\\n\\n## Setting up a rqlite cluster\\n\\nSetting up a rqlite cluster is easy thanks to its Docker support. You can create a distributed rqlite cluster using Docker Compose with just a few lines of configuration. Here\'s an example Docker Compose file for setting up a three-node rqlite cluster:\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: \'3\'\\n\\nservices:\\n  rqlite1:\\n    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest\\n    container_name: rqlite1\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"4001:4001\\"\\n      - \\"4002:4002\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./rqlite1:/rqlite\\n    command: [\\"rqlited\\", \\"-http-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4001\\", \\"-raft-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4002\\", \\"/rqlite/data/node1.db\\"]\\n\\n  rqlite2:\\n    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest\\n    container_name: rqlite2\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"4003:4001\\"\\n      - \\"4004:4002\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./rqlite2:/rqlite\\n    command: [\\"rqlited\\", \\"-http-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4001\\", \\"-raft-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4002\\", \\"-join\\", \\"rqlite1:4002\\", \\"/rqlite/data/node2.db\\"]\\n\\n  rqlite3:\\n    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest\\n    container_name: rqlite3\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"4005:4001\\"\\n      - \\"4006:4002\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./rqlite3:/rqlite\\n    command: [\\"rqlited\\", \\"-http-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4001\\", \\"-raft-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4002\\", \\"-join\\", \\"rqlite1:4002\\", \\"/rqlite/data/node3.db\\"]\\n```\\nThis configuration will set up a three-node rqlite cluster.\\n\\nConclusion\\nrqlite is a lightweight, distributed relational database that provides strong consistency guarantees, fault tolerance, and easy deployment.

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be easy to understand and implement, making it a good fit for rqlite\'s goals of simplicity and reliability.\\n\\nIn a rqlite cluster, one node serves as the leader, and the rest are followers. Clients interact with the leader node, which replicates their requests to the followers. If the leader fails, one of the followers is elected as the new leader, ensuring that the system remains available even in the face of failures.\\n\\n## Setting up a rqlite cluster\\n\\nSetting up a rqlite cluster is easy thanks to its Docker support. You can create a distributed rqlite cluster using Docker Compose with just a few lines of configuration. Here\'s an example Docker Compose file for setting up a three-node rqlite cluster:\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: \'3\'\\n\\nservices:\\n  rqlite1:\\n    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest\\n    container_name: rqlite1\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"4001:4001\\"\\n      - \\"4002:4002\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./rqlite1:/rqlite\\n    command: [\\"rqlited\\", \\"-http-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4001\\", \\"-raft-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4002\\", \\"/rqlite/data/node1.db\\"]\\n\\n  rqlite2:\\n    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest\\n    container_name: rqlite2\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"4003:4001\\"\\n      - \\"4004:4002\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./rqlite2:/rqlite\\n    command: [\\"rqlited\\", \\"-http-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4001\\", \\"-raft-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4002\\", \\"-join\\", \\"rqlite1:4002\\", \\"/rqlite/data/node2.db\\"]\\n\\n  rqlite3:\\n    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest\\n    container_name: rqlite3\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"4005:4001\\"\\n      - \\"4006:4002\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./rqlite3:/rqlite\\n    command: [\\"rqlited\\", \\"-http-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4001\\", \\"-raft-addr\\", \\"0.0.0.0:4002\\", \\"-join\\", \\"rqlite1:4002\\", \\"/rqlite/data/node3.db\\"]\\n```\\nThis configuration will set up a three-node rqlite cluster.\\n\\nConclusion\\nrqlite is a lightweight, distributed relational database that provides strong consistency guarantees, fault tolerance, and easy deployment. By leveraging the power of SQLite and the simplicity of the Raft consensus algorithm, rqlite is able to provide a reliable and easy-to-use distributed database solution for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in learning more about rqlite or trying it out for yourself, be sure to check out the official documentation and give it a try!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"facebook","permalink":"/blog/tags/facebook"},{"inline":true,"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.405,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jinna Baalu","title":"Infrastructure Solution Architect","url":"https://github.com/JinnaBaalu","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11784253?v=4","key":"jinna"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["jinna"],"tags":["facebook","hello","docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding rqlite: A Distributed Relational Database Built on SQLite","permalink":"/blog/rqlite"},"nextItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/blog/mdx-blog-post"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."},{"id":"mdx-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mdx-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"MDX Blog Post","description":"Blog posts support Docusaurus Markdown features, such as MDX.","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jinna Baalu","title":"Infrastructure Solution Architect","url":"https://github.com/JinnaBaalu","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11784253?v=4","key":"jinna"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mdx-blog-post","title":"MDX Blog Post","authors":["jinna"],"tags":["docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"},"nextItem":{"title":"Long Blog Post","permalink":"/blog/long-blog-post"}},"content":"Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse the power of React to create interactive blog posts.\\n\\n```js\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n```\\n\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"long-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/long-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","title":"Long Blog Post","description":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,","date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":2.05,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jinna Baalu","title":"Infrastructure Solution Architect","url":"https://github.com/JinnaBaalu","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11784253?v=4","key":"jinna"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"long-blog-post","title":"Long Blog Post","authors":"jinna","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/blog/mdx-blog-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"First Blog Post","permalink":"/blog/first-blog-post"}},"content":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,\\n\\nUse a `\x3c!--` `truncate` `--\x3e` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
