# Understanding rqlite: A Distributed Relational Database Built on SQLite

When it comes to distributed relational databases, one name that often comes up is rqlite. It's a lightweight, distributed relational database built on SQLite. In this post, we'll explore what rqlite is, how it works, and how you can use it in your projects.

## What is rqlite?

**rqlite** is a distributed relational database that uses SQLite as its storage engine. It provides a distributed database system with strong consistency guarantees, fault tolerance, and easy deployment. rqlite is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for applications that require a distributed database but don't need the complexity of larger systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## How does rqlite work?

rqlite uses the Raft consensus algorithm to achieve strong consistency and fault tolerance. Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be easy to understand and implement, making it a good fit for rqlite's goals of simplicity and reliability.

In a rqlite cluster, one node serves as the leader, and the rest are followers. Clients interact with the leader node, which replicates their requests to the followers. If the leader fails, one of the followers is elected as the new leader, ensuring that the system remains available even in the face of failures.

## Setting up a rqlite cluster

Setting up a rqlite cluster is easy thanks to its Docker support. You can create a distributed rqlite cluster using Docker Compose with just a few lines of configuration. Here's an example Docker Compose file for setting up a three-node rqlite cluster:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  rqlite1:
    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest
    container_name: rqlite1
    ports:
      - "4001:4001"
      - "4002:4002"
    volumes:
      - ./rqlite1:/rqlite
    command: ["rqlited", "-http-addr", "0.0.0.0:4001", "-raft-addr", "0.0.0.0:4002", "/rqlite/data/node1.db"]

  rqlite2:
    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest
    container_name: rqlite2
    ports:
      - "4003:4001"
      - "4004:4002"
    volumes:
      - ./rqlite2:/rqlite
    command: ["rqlited", "-http-addr", "0.0.0.0:4001", "-raft-addr", "0.0.0.0:4002", "-join", "rqlite1:4002", "/rqlite/data/node2.db"]

  rqlite3:
    image: rqlite/rqlite:latest
    container_name: rqlite3
    ports:
      - "4005:4001"
      - "4006:4002"
    volumes:
      - ./rqlite3:/rqlite
    command: ["rqlited", "-http-addr", "0.0.0.0:4001", "-raft-addr", "0.0.0.0:4002", "-join", "rqlite1:4002", "/rqlite/data/node3.db"]
```
This configuration will set up a three-node rqlite cluster.

Conclusion
rqlite is a lightweight, distributed relational database that provides strong consistency guarantees, fault tolerance, and easy deployment. By leveraging the power of SQLite and the simplicity of the Raft consensus algorithm, rqlite is able to provide a reliable and easy-to-use distributed database solution for a wide range of applications.
